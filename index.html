    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
    EAS is the most simple company.<br>
    We can incorporate with an italian friend located here that assisted me over the years, for about 500 USD.<br>
    At least the substitute director must be permanent resident of Paraguay. We offer two solutions for this: or I will be your appointed substitute director (with you the main director) for an annual fee or you get a second residency in Paraguay (that has no tax implication as long as you spent less than 120 days per year in the country). To become a resident you need two visits in Paraguay and a fee of about 1000 USD. We have first hand experience with this and you will be 100% approved in a few months.<br>
    You must provide an address in paraguay for the office (my place is available for this if I will be the appointed substitute director, otherwise there is a shared location included in the price).<br>
    Shareholders and other directors can be of any country , individuals or companies.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Taxation</h3>
    <p>
    EAS has 3 taxes:<br>
    IVA (vat) 10% but it's 0 for us since we invoice out of the country with a semi automated system.<br>
    IRE (income) 3% on the total income if you don't deduct national expenses or 10% if you deduct expenses (my fee to incorporate and to be your local director will be local expenses for example).<br>
    IDU (dividend) 8% paid only if you distribute the profits of the company<br>
    You will be not seen as an offshore incorporated business, with all the annexed consequences to invoice EU/US clients.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Regulation</h3>
    <p>
    Read the <a href="laws.html">AML/KYC laws</a>.<br>
    We are consulting with the SEPRELAD to understand the compliance requirements and if these laws also apply to self custodial Bitcoin and crypto self custodial business.<br>
    You can find our <a href="consulta.html">official consultation</a> to the SEPRELAD here.<br>
    We expect an official response by Q2/2025.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Invoicing</h3>
    <p>
    There are few option for invoicing:<br>
    Emit invoices manually from the Marangatu online system. The process is very simple. I emit my invoices here every day without external assistance. PYG nad USD are accepted but also others if necessary.<br>
    You can emit invoices programmatically with many dirrerent service offering API such as facturasend.<br>
    I have first hand experience with a local accountant for a fraction of what you would pay in Europe, but with a bit of exercise an accountant is not even needed and everything could be done on the Marangatu online system (if you understand Spanish).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Banking</h3>
    <p>
    Paraguay is one of the few countries in the world not part of the CRS system (there is no exchange of info with other countries, your info will remain private at the bank).<br>
    Opening a local business bank account for your company is pretty simple.<br>
    Online banks like Revolut and Wise are not available but there are some good alternative one of which supports local payment details in various ares like Wise.<br>
    Stripe for a paraguayan companies it's not supported, but there are good alternative available with medium market fee.<br>
    Alternatively, you can create a US/UK/CA subsidiary company owned by the paraguayan company, for 400 USD to process credit card payments. We have first hand experience with this and can handle all the process that is very easy.<br>
    We can also help you to accept bitcoin and USDT payments with a self custodial solution.<br>
    <p>
    <h3>Funding</h3>
    </p>
    One of the way to obtain Paraguayan passport after 3 years of permanent residency, is to be a shareholder of a company registered in the country.<br>
    I have some expats willing to invest in companies to become shareholders not for a profit but for the passport only.<br>
